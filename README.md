# flower-clock
The websites represents time as a sunflower! The sunflower has 12 petals, each corresponding to an hour in a standard 12-hour clock. 
The petal for the current hour is composed of three concentric petals, the smallest representing the seconds, the medium representing the minutes,
and the largest one representing the hour. As seconds pass, the smallest petal will grow to become the medium petal, and as minutes pass,
the medium petal will grow. When the hour passes, the medium petal will grow to become the outermost petal, before switching to the next petal.
