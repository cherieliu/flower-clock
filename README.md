# flower-clock
The websites represents time as a sunflower! The sunflower has petals, each corresponding to an hour in a standard 12-hour clock.
The flower has the number of petals equal to the number of hours that have passed, so the flower grows petals as time passes.

The petal for the current hour is composed of three concentric petals, the smallest representing the seconds, the medium representing the minutes,
and the largest one representing the hour. As seconds pass, the smallest petal will grow to become the medium petal, and as minutes pass,
the medium petal will grow. When the hour passes, the medium petal will grow to become the outermost petal, before switching to the next petal.
The background also changes color based on what hour it is! The closer the hour is to noon, the lighter blue it will be.
